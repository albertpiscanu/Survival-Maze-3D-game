	I created a 3D game using C++, OpenGL and GLSL. The aim of the game is for the player to get out of the maze in a limited time and without being killed by enemies. 
	Implementation details: 
  
    •	maze-generating algorithm used -> Backtracking Generator
    •	3D collision detection algorithm -> Axis-aligned bounding boxes  
    •	GLSL Noise Algorithm -> Perlin Noise
    •	both First- and Third-Person Perspectives are available
